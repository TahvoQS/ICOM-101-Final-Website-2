This website was made as a final project for ICOM-101, Media and Web Development at California Institute of the Arts.

It was coded by Tahvo Stephan using skills learned in class, and by doing aditional outside research. 

Languages used in this site are: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The website should be viewed as a work in progress and not a final portfilio site. Additional changes will be made in the future to further compleate the site.
